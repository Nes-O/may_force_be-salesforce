Let’s start with Prompt Builder in Salesforce, which is used to integrate generative AI into various workflows, enhancing user efficiency and customizing interactions through AI-generated content. 
Users can create different types of prompt templates, such as Sales Email, Field Generation, and Flex, which are adaptable to various data types and use cases within the Salesforce Platform. 

These templates leverage customer relationship management (CRM) data and can be invoked via Salesforce’s platform tools, allowing users to generate personalized communications and content dynamically. 
The management and customization of these templates involve a user interface (UI) where admins can revise and perfect templates based on feedback and performance, ensuring the AI outputs meet the desired standards and effectiveness.

Next, we have Einstein Copilot which enables users to interact with the system using natural language to perform tasks and retrieve information, effectively enhancing productivity by drawing answers from secure company data. 
The tool is embedded within the Salesforce ecosystem, respecting existing access controls and integrating with the Einstein Trust Layer for ethical and secure AI operations. 

Users can engage in conversational exchanges with Copilot, asking questions and receiving context-aware responses, thus simplifying tasks like summarizing deals or drafting emails without needing advanced technical skills. 
Unlike Einstein Bots, which require extensive setup and operate on rigid rules, Einstein Copilot offers a more user-friendly and flexible approach, utilizing a large language model (LLM) to understand and respond to user requests in a conversational manner.
