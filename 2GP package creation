Create 2GP managed package
The 2GP Package in Salesforce refers to the Second-Generation Managed Package, a modern packaging framework designed to 
simplify and improve app development and distribution on the Salesforce platform. 
It is an evolution of the First-Generation Managed Package (1GP) and provides developers with a more streamlined and 
flexible development lifecycle.

If you are starting a new project, Salesforce recommends using 2GP or Unlocked Packages for modern and scalable development workflows. 
1GP is generally discouraged for new development projects.
