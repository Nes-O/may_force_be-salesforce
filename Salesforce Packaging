Package in Salesforce
As per my understanding the word package is similar to jotting up everything and putting in a box. 
So in Salesforce, a package is a container that allows you to bundle together custom metadata, code, and other components into a single, distributable unit. 
Salesforce packages are not just limited to code and metadata. They can also include components like custom settings, email templates, reports, 
  dashboards, and even lightning components. The versatility makes packages a powerful tool for developers looking to share a wide range of customizations with 
    others in a structured and organized manner.
