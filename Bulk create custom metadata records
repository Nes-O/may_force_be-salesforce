## Bulk create custom metadata records
Usually for bulk creating records for sobjects we can use data loader and workbench. But the custom metadata records cannot be created like this. 
But they can be created via third party apps.

Now they can also be created via sfdx cli.
I had csv which I had to modify using gpt (For 30 analysing skills it worked really fine)

PS C:\--\New folder (3)\--> sfdx force:cmdt:record:insert --filepath data/csv_name.csv --typename xcdhcm__Custom_Public_Holiday_Settings__mdt
 »   Warning: @salesforce/cli update available from 2.54.6 to 2.56.7.
Error (ENOENT): ENOENT: no such file or directory, scandir 'C:\---\New folder (3)\---\force-app\main\default\objects\metadataName_mdt\fields'

PS C:\New folder (3)> sfdx force:cmdt:record:insert --filepath "filepath to the csv" --typename metadataName_mdt
 »   Warning: @salesforce/cli update available from 2.54.6 to 2.56.7.
Error (SfError): The column FullName is not found on the custom metadata type .

I was getting varied different types of error one of them was location issue of saving the csv. It should be ideally stored under data folder.
sfdx force:cmdt:record:insert --filepath "filepath/data/CSV.csv" --typename metadataName_mdt --namecolumn FullName
Here for this issue this command worked.

Now once the insertion was done I had to make sure the records that I inserted where correct in accordance with the csv.
So I used Salesforce Inspector to extract the metadatas into a csv format and then I did conditional formatting 
on the previous one of csv which I used to upload and the export that I did so as to verify if both of the records values
are same or not.
